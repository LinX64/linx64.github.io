## Context

Hi everyone!

I have been thinking about how to help jobseekers. I have been in this situation before and I know how
hard it is to find a job. I have been thinking about a new idea that could help jobseekers.

## The Idea

There are platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor. These platforms are great, but they are not
enough! Suppose you are a jobseeker and you are looking for a job. You have to go to each platform and search for the
job you want, and then apply.

This is a normal process, but it is not efficient. My idea is to have a unified and a **bank of jobs** for each sector,
where jobseekers can search for jobs and apply. The most interesting part in this application/platform would be the AI
matching process. The AI would match the jobseeker with the job, and once there was a match, it will send a notification
with Email or built-in notification system on mobile.

There are platforms where they have their own AI matching process, but they are not enough. They are limited
to their own jobs and postings, and they have few jobs or up-to-date jobs.

## Conclusion

I am working on this project [here](https://github.com/Employ-AI/android) and I would like to hear your thoughts about
it. I am open to any suggestions and collaborations.
