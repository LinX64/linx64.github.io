I work mostly as an Android Engineer, with a focus on Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Kotlin Coroutines, and all the new
technologies.
I also like to give talks and write articles about my experiences, and I am a
big fan of open source.

# Expertise

My expertise spans a wide range, from working with BLE devices and legacy projects (Java, XML, RxJava) to embracing new
technology stacks like Jetpack Compose, Kotlin, Coroutines, and CI/CD pipelines for fresh projects. I have a deep
appreciation for modern development practices and tooling, making extensive use of Jetpack Compose, Kotlin, Coroutines,
GitHub Actions, Firebase, and Compose multiplatform in my daily work.

Prior to my journey in mobile development, I explored the world of Cyber security as a penetration tester and shared my
knowledge as a lecturer. I am also the Founder and CEO of Rapid Brain, a Polish software development company, where
we're driven by a shared commitment to innovation and excellence.
