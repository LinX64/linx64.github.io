I am working mostly as an Android Engineer, with a focus on Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Kotlin Coroutines, and all the new
technologies. I was used to work as a Penetration Tester, means I possess a good knowledge of security on Linux-based
servers, Android, and web applications.

I also like to give talks and write articles about my experiences, and I am a big fan of open source.
